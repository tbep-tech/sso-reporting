<p>The following is an evaluation of FDEP spill incident reports for Tampa Bay, available at <a href="https://prodenv.dep.state.fl.us/DepPNP/reports/viewIncidentDetails" class="uri">https://prodenv.dep.state.fl.us/DepPNP/reports/viewIncidentDetails</a>, downloaded on <strong>2024-12-04</strong>. The workflow borrows from a previous analysis <a href="https://tbep-tech.github.io/piney-point-analysis/spills">here</a>.</p>

<p>The source data is created via public input and has not been quality assured. All of the reported spill volumes extracted from the database have not been visually checked and some values may be erroneous. Summaries by county refer only to geographic location, not the jurisdiction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The raw data have been filtered for the Tampa Bay watershed and only relevant columns have been retained. County estimates refer to only the portion of each county in the watershed. The source code for creating the data object is <a href="https://github.com/tbep-tech/sso-reporting/blob/main/R/dat_proc.R">here</a> and includes 2089 records from 2017-07-02 to 2024-11-28.</p>
<p>Spill volumes, if reported, can be extracted from the description column for each incident. These values were extracted from the text using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a> matching to identify numeric characters that were preceded by “spill volume” or followed by “gallons” or “mg” for million gallons. Records without any numeric characters in the description were first removed. If spill volume was reported, the estimate is used independent of whether gallons or million gallons are present in the remainder of the description. Incidents with more than one occurrence of “gallon” text strings used the highest volume present and incidents with “mg” reported have values multiplied by one million. If a text description included both gallons and million gallons, the former was used. No information about pollutants or other parameters are provided in the description.</p>

approximately 1:30 pm staff at the northwest regional water reclamation facility located at 10890 s mobley road in tampa discovered foam billowing from the #3 activated sludge digester. this incident continued off and on until approximately 7:30 am monday november 18 2024. the cause of the release was due to a faulty tank level indicator. this incident released approximately 19000 gallons of digested activated sludge and foam onto the ground. staff was able to stop the overflow by shutting air off to the effected tank and isolating the feed sludge. most of this release was contained on site. however during the cleanup approximately 200 gallons of the release was inadvertently pushed onto adjacent property and into a storm water pond. this stormwater pond is not connected to surface waters of the state. so far approximately 7500 gallons of the release has been vacuumed up and returned to the facility for processing. cleanup efforts are continuing and the effected area will be

construction by tlc diversified and tlc staff were onsite at the time of the sso and witnessed the lift station discharging raw wastewater onto the ground and into an onsite excavation.  the cause of this sso was an airlock in the lift station system and the total estimated volume of the discharge was 5000 gallons.  manatee county staff manipulated valves to divert some of the wastewater flow away from the lift station and the discharge stopped around 1:30 am on 10/5/24.  all of the discharged wastewater was maintained on the lift station/construction site with the majority contained within an excavated area.  the air lock was relieved to prevent a recurrence and all standing wastewater was recovered and returned to the collection system.  no storm water drains or surface waters of the
