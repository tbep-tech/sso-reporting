<p>The source data is created via public input and has not been quality assured. All of the reported spill volumes extracted from the database have not been visually checked. Only a handful were removed as being erroneous. Many spills also occur over several days and total volume per day may be much less than the maximum reported.</p>

The overflow was stopped by 4:00pm that afternoon after maintenance began on the private lift station to correct the problem.","902 22nd Ave W 8/29/2024 5:30PM - 8/31/2024 4AM\r\nVac truck used were possible\r\nExcessive rain surcharged the collection system\r\nEstimated 166,500 Gallons","902 21st Ave W 8/29/2024 5:30PM - 8/31/2024 4AM\r\nVac truck used were possible\r\nExcessive rain surcharged the collection system\r\nEstimated 166,500 Gallons","909 20th Ave W 8/29/2024 5:30PM - 8/31/2024 4AM\r\nVac truck used were possible\r\nExcessive rain surcharged the collection system\r\nEstimated 166,500 Gallons","907 20th Ave W intermittent from 2:30 AM - 8 AM\r\nVac truck used were possible\r\nExcessive rain surcharged the collection system\r\n7AM - 8AM 3,000 Gallons Observed prior volume unknown","1510 13th St W from 2:30 AM - 6:30 AM\r\nVac truck used were possible\r\nExcessive rain surcharged the collection system\r\nEstimated 81,000 Gallons","Numbers have been reflected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorida State Watch Office\r\nFlorida Division of Emergency Management\r\nOffice: 850-815-4001 / Fax: 850-815-4979\r\nSWP@em.myflorida.com\r\nwww.floridadisaster.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Brandon Martingano <Bmartingano@palmettofl.org> \r\nSent: Thursday, August 8, 2024 12:42\r\nTo: SWP | State Watch Office <swp@em.myflorida.com>\r\nCc: Emily.Larson@FloridaDEP.gov; Standridge, Jessie <Jessie.Standridge@FloridaDEP.gov>\r\nSubject: Wastewater 8.8 City of Palmetto\r\n\r\n\tCAUTION: This email originated from outside the organization.

The SSO occurred when a 6-inch force main broke causing the discharge of approximately 3,000 gallons of raw wastewater onto the ground.  Some of the wastewater flowed into a storm water swale downstream from the discharge location eventually soaking into the ground.  MCUD staff shut down the upstream lift station that feeds this force main to stop the discharge by around 1:20 PM.  A tanker was used to maintain the level of wastewater in the collection system while the upstream lift station was off line.  The force main was repaired and the impacted ground was washed down with potable water.  No wastewater or rinse water was recovered and no surface waters of the state were impacted by this SSO.  \r\r\r","The sanitary sewer overflow was the result of an electrical problem at a lift station, causing a back up of a manhole.

This has been occurring since Monday (Aug. 26) that we are aware. My husband called the city Monday with no response. He just called again this morning.I apologize for my lack of technical finesse. Here is approximate timeline of just this week. \r\n\r\nMonday August 26-sewer backflowing. Phone call to city with complaint made. No response. \r\n\r\nThursday August 29-sewer back flowing. Call to city made in the morning. City came out and placed a danger sign. Around 3pm, they returned. Backflow had stopped by 1pm. The city removed sign and cleaned street. Rain started around 3:30pm and by 4 pm the sewer was back flowing again at a higher rate. We made another call to city and they came back out and placed a danger sign. Don did take a video showing the discharge into canal showing the obvious change in color of the water. There is also an distinct sewer/waste water odor. \r\n\r\nAugust 30-sewer backflow is increasing this morning. As you can see on photo from this morning, the back flow drains directly into storm drain. The storm drain flows approximately 80-100 feet and empties into the canal behind my home. \r\n\r\nI just realized I do not know how to send several pics/videos at one time. The email will only send one. So, the photo you see is from this morning, Aug 30. \r\n\r\nAs a follow up, this sewer back flow has occurred 7 of the 8 years we have lived on this street.","A large amount of rain in a short period of time caused an SSO from a gravity main (I&I).

When the station pumps ran, the vertical pipe connected to the underground fitting was raising slightly out of the gasketed restrained fitting.  An excavator bucket was used to keep constant downward pressure on the vertical piping to lessen the amount of wastewater that overflowed.  A berm directed the overflow to an on-site private storm pond, where a high head pump was utilized to pump the overflow back into the system via the discharge manifold leaving the site. Another high head pump at the site of the leak directed flow back into the wet well.  When the flow was initially directed to the on-site pond, the pond was overwhelmed and a portion of the wastewater flowed over a weir to a stormwater ditch flowing to Channel A. Several stations in this basin are being pumped out with pump trucks to lessen the flow coming to Sheldon Super. The decision has been made to install HDPE bypass piping utilizing the on-site stationary diesel pump to bypass the station in order to make the needed repairs. This is ongoing and as more information is gathered, the report will be updated.

For several days the plant Sludge\r\nVolume Index dropped and the biological life vanished. This was caused by construction activities and heavy rain. The\r\nprevious weeks the RAS line was bypassed due to construction activities and we could not sample RAS for process\r\ncontrol during this time. When the bypass was over RAS was found to be elevated for a few days we adjusted\r\nRAS/WAS rates to try and improve the plant. Also during this time we received over 7 inches of rain between 5/20 and\r\n5/25. In addition to the hydraulic overload this may have caused, the construction company was pumping out trenches\r\nthat filled with water and we discovered one of our containment areas was receiving muddy rain water sending it\r\nstraight to the plant lift station. We immediately instructed them to relocate the pumped out water. However, the\r\ndamage was done, micro analysis on 5/26 showed very little bug life and a beat up floc. We again tried making\r\nadjustments to the plant, including adding an Alum drip to clarifiers and filters, but the next day still went into reject. On\r\n5/30 we started to receive seed sludge and the turbidity began to go down. The water entering the reject pond was highly treated effluent that could not enter the reuse system because of elevated turbidity. On 5/31, the plant operators became aware that the reject pond began to overflow into the ditch surrounding the reject pond late the night before. A pump was installed to pump the highly treated effluent from the ditch into the onsite RRIB for containment. The plant came out of reject the morning of 5/31, but went back into reject a few hours later. The plant came out of reject completely at 8:30 am on 6/3, ceasing the unpermitted discharge. During the event, 15.924 MG of effluent was sent to the reject pond and 6.3 million gallons of that was pumped from the reject pond into the RRIBs. Once there was enough room in the reject pond, 1.68 MG of effluent was pumped from the RRIBs back to the reject pond and 9.6 MG of effluent was returned to the headworks from the reject pond. No waterways were impacted and there is no risk to public health.","On May 26, 2023, the City of Tampa Wastewater Department became aware of a wastewater overflow near 1302 N. 25th St. due to a control system failure at the 25th St. Pumping Station.

The delay in confirmation of the source was due to the location of the actual leak being under the foundation of the HRSG. During this time period, a contractor was hired to conduct soft digs in the area.  The station blocked off the nearby stormwater drain, preventing any discharge to surface waters. As of the time of confirmation, we have estimated that 11,520 gallons of service water had been discharged from the leaking pipe to the ground underneath the 4D HRSG concrete pad at a rate of 1 gallon per minute.  No discharges to surface waters or off-site have occurred. The station identified an isolation valve to this line and closed it, however the valve would not seal fully, resulting in a small volume leak by.  Station has a specialty contractor arriving the afternoon of 9/14 to install a ¿hot tap¿ stop valve in the line.  Additionally the station has a small sump pump installed at the leak location/excavation area, this sump pump is removing remaining leak by and pumping to HRSG blowdown tank sump (an approved wastewater sump). The leaking water was sampled on 9/6/22 and had a pH of 7.6 s.u., the full laboratory report will be submitted to FDEP with the 5-day follow-up written report. This notice will be updated as needed.\r\n9/19/22 update: A specialty contractor is scheduled to arrive the morning of 9/21/22 to cut the pipe upstream of the crack and install a cap to stop the leak. Estimated total amount of service water discharged to the ground as of 9/19/22 is 13,680 gallons, with 2,160 gallons recovered (as of 9/14 we are able to collect the leaking service water and pump it to an authorized wastewater sump)\r\n9/23/22 update: The specialty contractor did not complete the required safety training to be able to perform work on-site. They are the only contractor that has the ability to work on HDPE piping. They are now scheduled to do the work on 10/8/22. We have continued to collect the leaking service water and pump it to an authorized wastewater sump.  Estimated total amount discharged so far is 15,120 gallons, with 3,600 gallons recovered and discharged to the sump.\r\n10/12/22 update: After delays caused by the contractor, the repair was completed and confirmed on 10/12/22.

Prior to 2006 the property was converted from a trailer park to vehicle and boat storage with horse boarding stables being added in 2012.  It is currently used for commercial equipment and vehicle storage under the name of Domino Self storage.\r\nPollution Incidents: The property owner describes an existing structure located on the Northern section of the property as a wastewater lift station that is not currently in use.  Septic tanks are lying near the lift station.   The abutting ¿Tis-A-Wee¿ trailer court used septic tanks that were removed in 2005, subsequent to its sale in 2004. \r\nThe horse boarding stalls, currently not in use, are located adjacent to the wetland and a drainage ditch.   Manure runoff and discard into the water bodies are likely. \r\nVarious types and sizes of commercial vehicles and equipment (some in running order and others in obvious disrepair) have been stored on pervious surfaces for 15 years.  Petroleum leaks and spillage are common. \r\nA private well provided potable water to the trailer park and now to the property owner¿s home.

A citizen notified Polk County Utilities (PCU) of the leak and that a private lawn service was in the area working when the incident occurred. Upon investigation, PCU staff concluded that the ARV was likely damaged by an unknown vehicle, possibly related to the presence of the private lawn service. The ARV was shut off to prevent further discharge until repairs were completed. Approximately 200 gallons was recovered and properly disposed of in accordance with all regulatory requirements. The affected area was treated with lime for disinfection. Clean-up actions were completed at approximately 5:38 PM on September 16, 2020. The spill did not enter any surface water bodies, and did not pose a potential risk to public health, safety or welfare.  \r\n","This incident was reported through the FDEP to comply with FS Section 403.077 on August 17, 2024.  The incident was initially presumed to be a sanitary sewer overflow (SSO) believed to be caused by a leak in a wastewater forcemain at or near (or under) a private pond feature at the Bays End Manor Mobile Home Community (MHC).  The pond has no apparent positive outfall to Old Tampa Bay and is located close to the high-water mark of the bay.  The private pond is not considered a \"Water of the State of Florida\" or a Water of the US and previously served as a rapid infiltration pond for an on-site sewage treatment facility (now decommissioned for that purpose).  The pond is fenced and not openly accessible to the public. The water is considered Class V (utility service).\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Actions and Preventative Measures:  On August 19, 2024, Plummer Associates was retained to investigate the incident and provide recommendations for preventative measures in the event that the pond could potentially contain sewage and possibly discharge offsite.  At the time of the investigation, all sewage flow from the Bays End MHC had been isolated and contained within the Bays End Manor wastewater pump station wetwell, where it was continually hauled offsite by a licensed septage hauler (as of August 16, 2024). There was no evidence of an active discharge of sewage nor was there evidence of a forcemain leak or overflow of the pond at the time of the inspection.  \r\n\r\nPlummer Associates and a licensed underground utility contractor were independently engaged to provide emergency preventative measures to avoid any potential discharge of sewage in the event there was a confirmed leak in the forcemain. Plummer Associates reviewed options to provide an emergency diversion of wastewater flow around the pond feature and inspected the initial installation of a 3-inch PVC forcemain.  The new forcemain installation was completed and the pump station restarted within 24 hours of the Plummer Associates inspection.  An final inspection and testing of the completed emergency procedure is pending as of this notice.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Protection: The existing Bays End Manor pond is considered an \"other surface water\" feature that is isolated from Class III waters and has no intended discharge point.  In the interest of protecting the public and/or Old Tampa Bay from potential future sanitary source overflows, Bays End Manor MHC has proposed development of an SSO Emergency Action Plan and Sanitary Sewer Maintenance Plan program to be prepared by Plummer Associates. This is currently underway and will address specific procedures for pump station maintenance, emergency generator inspections, and future SSO emergency remedial actions.  \r\n\r\nPlummer Associates cannot verify the events where any offsite discharge from the private pond to Old Tampa Bay was evident and therefore cannot issue a statement that offsite discharge to Old Tampa Bay occurred as a result of the implied failure of the forcemain.  However, Plummer Associates acknowledges that the Florida Department of Health performed an investigation of the incident and closed the investigation noting that no apparent presence of sewage had been verified from the inspection.  For this reason, the statement regarding offsite discharge identified in this form is qualified herein to indicate that there is no conclusive evidence provided to Plummer Associates that an offsite discharge of sewage occurred from the private pond to Old Tampa Bay.\r\n\r\nA subsequent report has been filed under separate direct cover to FDEP that provides reasonable assurance that no offsite discharge occurred as a result of the incident.

Upon arrival, staff found manhole MH13232 discharging wastewater into a storm water drain located at the northeast corner of the intersection.  This SSO was due to nearly 3.5 inches of rain, in a short period of time, causing the collection system to surcharge in this area and resulting in the discharge from MH13232.  The total estimated volume of the SSO event was 54,000 gallons. Pump trucks were used to remove wastewater from an affected lift station to maintain a working level in the gravity sewer system and ultimately stopped the overflow at approximately 11:59 pm. Crews were unable to perform additional cleanup due to areas of localized flooding.  The recovered wastewater was taken to the Southwest Water Reclamation Facility for disposal. Bacteriological samples were not collected from a potentially impacted storm water retention pond, located to the south of 53rd Avenue East and to the west of 3rd Street East, due to inaccessibility.\r\r","Water Department personnel received notification by Alpha Utility of a hit main or service at 301 W Platt St. During the initial investigation, it was determined that the reclaimed main was leaking due to damage caused by a directional drill operation.

However, the bypass gates were closed. Gate limit switches were under repair requiring the gates to be operated in hand. New limit switches had been on order, and the plant staff is reviewing the SOP for high flow events. The storm drains & storm vault are directing flow to headworks due to construction at the facility; any spilled flow that reached the storm drains was recovered in the stormwater vault and rerouted to headworks for treatment. \r\n     The area around headworks is currently under construction, and much of the pavement has been removed. Under normal circumstances, spills at this area of the plant would be routed to the stormwater vault and pumped back to headworks.

On a plant tour the operations staff noticed a partially open ball valve on a bleach tank was open and leaking Sodium Hypochlorite.  The operations staff closed the valve immediately and stopped the leak.  We used a vacuum truck to remove the rainwater and bleach mixture and put it in the in-plant lift station.  We used spill kits to remove any potentially contaminated dirt in the surrounding area.  The potentially contaminated soil will be disposed of in an appropriate manner.  We completed the cleanup at 8:25 PM.  The National Response Center has been notified and provided the following incident number:  1255490.  The State Warning Point has been notified and provided the following incident number:  2019-4705.  \r\n\r\nUpdate:  We believe a large portion of the spilled sodium hypochlorite went down a drain located on the concrete pad where the spill occurred. This drain discharges back to the plant flow stream so any sodium hypochlorite that did go down the drain was captured and not released. We cannot determine the amount that went down the drain with confidence because there is no metering of that flow and because it was raining throughout the day that this spill occurred.  Therefore, we are hereby reporting the entire amount of sodium hypochlorite that was lost from the storage tank; 577 gallons of 12% trade strength.  \r\n\r\nWhen we were aware of the spill we dispatched our vac trucks to remove the standing rain water in the localized area where we found a chloride residual. This water was returned to the wastewater plant. We then excavated soil in the area where the water containing chlorine came into contact with it. We filled three 55 gallon spill kits with potentially contaminated dirt and with absorbent material. This material will be disposed of properly through a contractor. \r\n","Due to heavy rain and very high flows at the SWWRF, the chlorine contact chamber overflowed when the backwash pumps that transfer reject water to the reject tanks could not keep up with the over 60 MGD flow rate.

Harbour Island Blvd.  Personnel responded to the site and found wastewater overflowing from several manholes located in the parking garage.  The wastewater was flowing into to floor drains that discharge into the Seddon Channel.  After further investigation it was determined that the overflow was due to a partially clogged bypass pump at the Harbour Island pumping station.  This station is currently being rehabilitated under a City contract.  Bypass pumps are being used to bypass the flow to the station while the work is completed.  The bypass pumping system is equipped with a second auxiliary pump; however, this pump failed to start due to a dead battery.  The blockage in the primary pump was removed and the overflow stopped.  The Contractor responsible for the rehabilitation project and the operation of the bypass pumping station is replacing the battery and is working to remove the wastewater that collected in the parking garage and clean up the area.","Sewer line stoppage caused manhole to overflow and discharge approximately 20,100 gallons of raw sewage.

<!-- Spill volumes, if reported, can be identified in the description column for each incident.  These values were extracted from the text using [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) matching to identify numeric characters that were preceded by "volume" or followed by "gallons".  Records without any numeric characters in the description were first removed.  Incidents with more than one occurrence of "gallon" text strings were also removed because of ambiguity over which value referred to the spill. No information about pollutants or other parameters are provided in the description.  -->
