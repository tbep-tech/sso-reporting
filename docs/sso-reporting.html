<p>The following is an evaluation of FDEP spill incident reports for Tampa Bay, available at <a href="https://prodenv.dep.state.fl.us/DepPNP/reports/viewIncidentDetails" class="uri">https://prodenv.dep.state.fl.us/DepPNP/reports/viewIncidentDetails</a>, downloaded on <strong>2024-12-04</strong>. The workflow borrows from a previous analysis <a href="https://tbep-tech.github.io/piney-point-analysis/spills">here</a>.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The source data is created via public input and has not been quality assured. All of the reported spill volumes extracted from the database have not been visually checked and some values may be erroneous.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The raw data have been filtered for the Tampa Bay watershed and only relevant columns have been retained. County estimates refer to only the portion of each county in the watershed. The source code for creating the data object is <a href="https://github.com/tbep-tech/sso-reporting/blob/main/R/dat_proc.R">here</a> and includes 2089 records from 2017-07-02 to 2024-11-28.</p>
<p>Spill volumes, if reported, can be extracted from the description column for each incident. These values were extracted from the text using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a> matching to identify numeric characters that were preceded by “spill volume” or followed by “gallons” or “mg” for million gallons. Records without any numeric characters in the description were first removed. If spill volume was reported, the estimate is used independent of whether gallons or million gallons are present in the remainder of the description. Incidents with more than one occurrence of “gallon” text strings used the highest volume present and incidents with “mg” reported have values multiplied by one million. If a text description included both gallons and million gallons, the former was used. No information about pollutants or other parameters are provided in the description.</p>

continued off and on until approximately 7:30 am monday november 18 2024. the cause of the release was due to a faulty tank level indicator. this incident released approximately 19000 gallons of digested activated sludge and foam onto the ground. staff was able to stop the overflow by shutting air off to the effected tank and isolating the feed sludge. most of this release was contained on site. however during the cleanup approximately 200 gallons of the release was inadvertently pushed onto adjacent property and into a storm water pond. this stormwater pond is not connected to surface waters of the state. so far approximately 7500 gallons of the release has been vacuumed up and returned to the facility for processing. cleanup efforts are continuing and the effected area will be

manatee county utilities department (mcud) staff were notified of a sanitary sewer overflow (sso) located behind the house at 415 61st street nw in bradenton.  the sso occurred when an 8\" force main broke causing raw wastewater to discharge onto the ground.  the discharge stopped around 10 pm when the upstream lift stations were taken out of service and tankers were used to maintain the water level in the collection system.  the force main was repaired and returned to service but two additional breaks were discovered between the original location and behind the house at 415 62nd street nw.  the upstream lift stations were shut down and tankers were again mobilized to maintain the water level in the collection system until final repairs were completed around 12:30 pm on 9/6/24.  the total discharge volume of this intermittent sso event is preliminarily estimated to be greater than 16000 gallons with some of the wastewater entering a stormwater drain which conveys water into warners bayou west but a final volume will be provided once field data can be analyzed.  wastewater compliance staff collected fecal coliform and entercocci samples to determine the extent of impact on surface waters.  warning signs will be posted today at neighborhood ingresses surrounding the potentially affected surface waters.  update: another break in the force main occurred 3 feet away from where the last break occurred causing an additional raw wastewater discharge that began 9/6/24 at 4:30 pm.  mcud staff were able to stop the discharge by 9/7/24 at 12:30 am by shutting down upstream lift stations and utilizing tanker trucks to maintain water levels in the collection system.  the discharge wastewater was confined to the force main repair worksite and backyard of 415 61st street nw

downward pressure on the vertical piping to lessen the amount of wastewater that overflowed.  a berm directed the overflow to an on-site private storm pond where a high head pump was utilized to pump the overflow back into the system via the discharge manifold leaving the site. another high head pump at the site of the leak directed flow back into the wet well.  when the flow was initially directed to the on-site pond the pond was overwhelmed and a portion of the wastewater flowed over a weir to a stormwater ditch flowing to channel a. several stations in this basin are being pumped out with pump trucks to lessen the flow coming to sheldon super. the decision has been made to install hdpe bypass piping utilizing the on-site stationary diesel pump to bypass the station in order to make the needed repairs. this is ongoing and as more information is gathered the report will be updated.  regulatory agency notification was made at 1:24pm.\r\nupdate: on june 25th 2024 at 7:45am

due to a lightning alert from hurricane idalia we were not able to get a team to the area until 6:30 am at which point the team immediately stopped discharge from the recycle water line. based on the normal flow rates through the ruptured line and the sump volume as well as backup systems we estimate that greater than 1000 gallons were released into the ditches. a call was made this morning to the state watch office and we were given incident number 2023-7155.&emsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><th>county&emsp;<\/th><td>Hillsborough&emsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><th>volest&emsp;<\/th><td>

approximately 4:00 pm it was confirmed that the source of an underground leak that was initially suspected on the evening of 9/5/22 was service water which consists of potable water and reused industrial wastewater (hrsg blowdown reheat blowdown and evaporative cooler blowdown). the delay in confirmation of the source was due to the location of the actual leak being under the foundation of the hrsg. during this time period a contractor was hired to conduct soft digs in the area.  the station blocked off the nearby stormwater drain preventing any discharge to surface waters. as of the time of confirmation we have estimated that 11520 gallons of service water had been discharged from the leaking pipe to the ground underneath the 4d hrsg concrete pad at a rate of 1 gallon per minute.  no discharges to surface waters or off-site have occurred. the station identified an isolation valve to this line and closed it however the valve would not seal fully resulting in a small volume leak by.  station has a specialty contractor arriving the afternoon of 9/14 to install a ¿hot tap¿ stop valve in the line.  additionally the station has a small sump pump installed at the leak location/excavation area this sump pump is removing remaining leak by and pumping to hrsg blowdown tank sump (an approved wastewater sump). the leaking water was sampled on 9/6/22 and had a ph of 7.6 s.u. the full laboratory report will be submitted to fdep with the 5-day follow-up written report. this notice will be updated as needed.\r\n9/19/22 update: a specialty contractor is scheduled to arrive the morning of 9/21/22 to cut the pipe upstream of the crack and install a cap to stop the leak. estimated total amount of service water discharged to the ground as of 9/19/22 is 13680 gallons with 2160 gallons recovered (as of 9/14 we are able to collect the leaking service water and pump it to an authorized wastewater sump)\r\n9/23/22 update: the specialty contractor did not complete the required safety training to be able to perform work on-site. they are the only contractor that has the ability to work on hdpe piping. they are now scheduled to do the work on 10/8/22. we have continued to collect the leaking service water and pump it to an authorized wastewater sump.  estimated total amount discharged so far is 15120 gallons with 3600 gallons recovered and discharged to the sump.\r\n10/12/22 update: after delays caused by the contractor the repair was completed and confirmed on 10/12/22.  the estimated total amount discharged since discovery of the leak was 21960 with 10440 gallons recovered and discharged to the sump. \r\n&emsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><th>county&emsp;<\/th><td>Pinellas&emsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><th>volest&emsp;<\/th><td>

near 7003 7011 and 7019 port marnock place in the lakewood ranch subdivision (vilamoura) discharging wastewater to the street.  with further investigation it was determined that one of the pump riser pipes in the arnold palmer green #1 lift station (rtu 689) had broken causing a high water level in the station and resulting in the wastewater discharge from the three identified upstream manholes.  three tankers and 2 jet vac trucks were used to lower the level in the collection system and stop the sso discharge by around 11:00 am.  these trucks were also used to vacuum up all standing wastewater on the pavement and rinse down the affected area.  a bypass pumping system was set up around the affected lift station until final repairs can be completed.  the total amount of the

clearwater's east facility  (3141 gulf-to-bay blvd. clearwater fl).  on a plant tour the operations staff noticed a partially open ball valve on a bleach tank was open and leaking sodium hypochlorite.  the operations staff closed the valve immediately and stopped the leak.  we used a vacuum truck to remove the rainwater and bleach mixture and put it in the in-plant lift station.  we used spill kits to remove any potentially contaminated dirt in the surrounding area.  the potentially contaminated soil will be disposed of in an appropriate manner.  we completed the cleanup at 8:25 pm.  the national response center has been notified and provided the following incident number:  1255490.  the state warning point has been notified and provided the following incident number:  2019-4705.  \r\n\r\nupdate:  we believe a large portion of the spilled sodium hypochlorite went down a drain located on the concrete pad where the spill occurred. this drain discharges back to the plant flow stream so any sodium hypochlorite that did go down the drain was captured and not released. we cannot determine the amount that went down the drain with confidence because there is no metering of that flow and because it was raining throughout the day that this spill occurred.  therefore we are hereby reporting the entire amount of sodium hypochlorite that was lost from the storage tank; 577 gallons of 12% trade strength.  \r\n\r\nwhen we were aware of the spill we dispatched our vac trucks to remove the standing rain water in the localized area where we found a chloride residual. this water was returned to the wastewater plant. we then excavated soil in the area where the water containing chlorine came into contact with it. we filled three 55 gallon spill kits with potentially contaminated dirt and with absorbent material. this material will be disposed of properly through a contractor.

infiltration caused by excessive rainfall in the area combined with a suspected homeowner draining his property through a cleanout.  the total combined estimated volume of the discharge from all locations was 70000 gallons.  tanker trucks were used to maintain the wastewater level in the collection system to minimize the sso discharges and final cleanup will be completed today.  the wastewater did enter a drainage ditch in the area so wastewater compliance staff are conducting an investigation to determine any impact to surface

occurred 8/21/18 3-3:15pm due to the discharge line not keeping up with the incoming flow. it was around 500 gallons (overestimated amount) the soil was excavated as an additional precautionary measure by a contractor act and hauled off. cleanup was completed by 8pm last night. initial notification was received for this and the final details outlined above were received via a phone conversation today with fdep. the reporting for the situation at the elementary school is complete. \r\n \r\n2.\tfriday 8/17/18 the city notified the department of a potential overflow situation wherein a contractor was repairing/replacing a sewer line and two lateral lines going to residences were disconnected from the sewer main. the contractor thought that it would suffice to put in a 55-gallon container to catch any wastewater from the residences. fdep notified the city of mulberry would be liable for any sewage overflows that may occur and that they need to have their contractor come up with a better solution to divert the wastewater to avoid any potential overflows since they would be stopping work for the weekend\r\n \r\ncity contacted fdep monday evening august 20th 2018 to inform fdep of a 500-gallon overflow that occurred as a result of the contractor issue from friday. city called fdep yesterday tuesday august 21st 2018 around 4:20pm of the purcell elementary overflow and to updated fdep on the contractor issue at 1st avenue. at that point the contractor was still not complying with any of the city¿s or engineer's requests for them to address the lateral line issues. the city manager sent a letter to the contractor telling them to cease work at the site.  \r\n \r\ncurrently the contractor is at the site pumping water out of the pit where the sewer line is (~15 feet deep) in an effort to correct the problem. \r\n\r\n9/4/18 update:\r\n\r\n1.\tcontractor for city (hinterland group) has installed a 2nd backup bypass pump with a float start switch and auto-dialer to alert if an alarm condition occurs.  the 1st bypass pump is set to run continuously as is necessary to avoid sewage backups in purcell elementary and the 2nd backup pump has a float switch which is located approximately 1 ft above the bottom of the manhole to start if the primary backup pump does not keep up with incoming flows or otherwise has a failure.  \r\n2.\tcontractor has replaced the temporary lateral collection system with a system that includes a more robust steel drum and submersible electric motor-powered pump with steel lid. the discharge from the pump system is routed to a downstream manhole.\r\nit is estimated that the total volume of sewage spilled from the two services does not exceed the following:\r\n1 day x 2 services x 225 gpd per service per day = 450 gallons  \r\n3.\ton 8/22/18 the city notified the dept. of a water main break within the area of excavation.  as a result the excavation pit was filled with potable water and required to be pumped down. the water being pumped from the excavation was primarily potable water but was partially contaminated with the sewage that had spilled into the excavation as reported in item 2 above.  the contractor pumped water from the excavation pit and discharged eastward down e. badcock blvd. there was no new sewage spilled during this event; the source of sewage contamination was the sewage spilled from the two sewer laterals described above that was in the excavation pit.\r\n4.\ton 8/23/18 the city notified the dept. of a second water main break within the area of excavation. as a result the excavation pit was again filled with potable water and required to be pumped down.  the water being pumped from the excavation was primarily potable water but was partially contaminated

the traffic lanes due to the line\r\nbeing ruptured under the roadway. once the lanes were closed and excavation was underway the leak was found to be a nickel size hole in the side of the 8\"\r\ndip sludge line. approximately 1800 gallons escaped the line before we were able to safely excavate the area. the team was able to install a full circle repair\r\nclamp on the line and stop the leak without isolating anything. all the soiled spoil was removed from the site and clean dry fill was brought for backfilling the\r\narea in lifts with the top layer being a load of millings. acme

wastewater department became aware of wastewater overflow at 8301 north dale mabry due to a broken check valve on a privately maintained wastewater pumping station. the broken check valve allowed wastewater to discharge from the pumping station due to the back pressure in the city's force main along dale mabry hwy.  department crews responded to the location and used vactor trucks to recover the wastewater until the pumping station could be isolated from the city's force main.  the owner of the privately maintained pumping station is the process of replacing the broken check valve.  the connection to the city's force main will remain isolated until the repairs have been completed.  \r\n\r\nthe volume of the overflow is estimated at 2160 gallons and it is estimated that 1000 gallons were recovered.  the overflow discharged into the parking lot adjacent to the pumping station and into the pond located east of the

was able to isolate the lpss force main and stop the sso at about 12:00pm. the lpss team began removing the sewer from the storm ditches using the lpss pump truck. after collecting the accumulated sewer they reported a 2000 gallon sso with 1800 gallons recovered and put back into the system. after recovering the sso the lpss team excavated the site of the leak and found a broken pvc saddle tap

chlorinators 2 & 3 were valved into that evaporator. because of this the cl2 feed dropped out causing the pre-so2 residual to drop below 1.0 mg/l for 5 minutes from 22:19 to 22:23. a grab sample was taken at the lowest residual with a result of 0.94 mg/l. the flow was immediately slowed by shutting off all but one nitrification pump and diverting flow into the empty contact chamber. although most of the flow was diverted it is estimated that 62000 gallons of <1.0 mg/l residual water went over the weir before the residual was
